# Pirate-s-Gold

Calculus course project to build a game using converging sequences. These sequences were used for generat-
ing random numbers using the converging property of the sequences. These random numbers were the co-efficients of the
trajectories of the moving gold coins, which were to be collected by the user. This was basically a UI less game working
only on the terminal.
